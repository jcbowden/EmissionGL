# EmissionGL
A data visulisation and analysis program written using Delphi 3 Object Pascal.

Initially used to display large x-y plots of gas emission spectra colleted during my PhD. Morphed into semi general stats tool which was superseded by conversion of the computational parts to C++ during my Postdoc and then this was then replaced by use of R!
